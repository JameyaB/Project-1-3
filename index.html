    <p>My name is Jameya Brown and Im current a CIS major on track to transfer in Spring 2027. Before attending Cerritos college, I was a student at Downey High School and graduated in the year 2023. After juggling with which majors I wanted to pursue and what I wanted to do with my life I landed on Computer Science. The math is challenging and I'd say discrete structures is a class I struggle with the most, but Im hanging in there.</p>
<h1>In My Free Time: </h1>
<ol>
<li>I step away from the computer to draw in my sketchpad</li>
<li>Play sandbox games like Minecraft or Rimworld</li>
<li>Go for walks around the neighborhood</li>
</ol>
<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://toyhou.se/">Toyhouse</a> because I enjoy seeing the creativity of people across the internet and it sparked my interest in learning HTML and CSS.</p>
